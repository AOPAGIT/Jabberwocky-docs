Sitecore MVC provides many implementation options, and initially it can difficult to choose a path among all of them:

	* Controller Renderings
	* View Renderings
	* Item Renderings
	* etc.

To make matters a little more confusing, Sitecore MVC is a different beast than vanilla ASP.NET MVC.  In the former, routes aren't handled by the controller naming convention like in ASP.NET MVC, but instead are handled by Sitecore's regular routing methodology - namely, based on an item path in Sitecore.

In order to help accelerate MVC development in Sitecore, we've developed a standard set of practices that you can incorporate into your own projects.
